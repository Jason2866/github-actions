# Fork of Espressif Github Actions

[Github Actions](https://developer.github.com/actions/) developed by Espressif to help manage GitHub repositories.

- [release_zips](release_zips/) creates a zip file from a tagged version to attach to a release (recursive clone, unlike the automatic GitHub source archives.)
